# Security Scan Workflow

## Overview

The `Security Scan` workflow is a comprehensive security analysis tool that performs code vulnerability scanning, static analysis, and dependency checking for the Concept Visualizer project. It helps identify security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and outdated dependencies that might pose security risks.

## Triggers

This workflow runs when:

- Code is pushed to the `main` branch
- Pull requests are opened against the `main` branch
- Weekly on Sunday at 1:30 AM UTC (cron: `30 1 * * 0`)
- Manually triggered via GitHub Actions interface (workflow_dispatch)

## Workflow Structure

### CodeQL Analysis

**Job name**: `analyze`

This job uses GitHub's CodeQL to perform advanced static analysis:

1. Runs separate analyses for JavaScript and Python code (matrix strategy)
2. Initializes the CodeQL engine for each language
3. Autobuilds the codebase to prepare for analysis
4. Performs in-depth security analysis
5. Reports findings to GitHub Security dashboard

The job requires special permissions:

- `actions: read`
- `contents: read`
- `security-events: write`

### Dependency Scan

**Job name**: `dependency-scan`

This job checks both frontend and backend dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

#### Backend Dependency Scan

1. Sets up Python 3.11
2. Installs the safety package for vulnerability detection
3. Installs project dependencies
4. Runs safety check to identify vulnerable dependencies
5. Reports findings but continues the workflow even if vulnerabilities are found

#### Frontend Dependency Scan

1. Sets up Node.js 18
2. Installs frontend dependencies
3. Runs npm audit to check for vulnerable npm packages
4. Reports findings but continues the workflow even if vulnerabilities are found

## Security Benefits

This workflow provides several key security benefits:

1. **Code Quality**: Identifies anti-patterns and potential bugs that could lead to security issues
2. **Vulnerability Detection**: Finds known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Scheduled runs ensure continuous security validation
4. **Multiple Technologies**: Covers both Python and JavaScript ecosystems
5. **Integration with GitHub Security**: Findings appear in the Security tab for easy tracking

## Interpreting Results

When vulnerabilities are found:

1. For CodeQL findings, check the Security tab in GitHub
2. For dependency vulnerabilities, review the workflow logs
3. Prioritize fixes based on severity and exploitability
4. Update dependencies or modify code to address identified issues

## Configuration

The workflow is configured to:

- Continue despite finding vulnerabilities (allowing the team to prioritize fixes)
- Run on a regular schedule to catch new vulnerabilities
- Use multiple analysis tools for comprehensive coverage

## Customization

The workflow can be customized by:

1. Adding additional languages to the CodeQL matrix
2. Modifying the failure thresholds for dependency scanners
3. Changing the schedule frequency
4. Adding notification mechanisms for critical findings
