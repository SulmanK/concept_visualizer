# Palette Generation Stage

The Palette Generation stage contains functions for generating color palettes for concepts and creating variations of images using those palettes.

## Functions

### generate_palettes_for_concept

```python
async def generate_palettes_for_concept(
    task_id: str,
    theme_desc: str,
    logo_desc: str,
    num: int,
    concept_service: Any
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Generate color palettes for a concept.

    Args:
        task_id: The ID of the task
        theme_desc: Theme description for palette generation
        logo_desc: Logo description for palette generation
        num: Number of palettes to generate
        concept_service: ConceptService instance

    Returns:
        List of color palette dictionaries

    Raises:
        Exception: If palette generation fails
    """
```

This function generates color palettes based on the concept's theme and logo descriptions:

1. Calls the concept service's `generate_color_palettes` method with the provided parameters
2. Validates the returned palettes to ensure they're in the expected format
3. Returns the list of color palette dictionaries

### create_palette_variations

```python
async def create_palette_variations(
    task_id: str,
    image_data: bytes,
    palettes: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    user_id: str,
    image_service: Any
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Create image variations using the given palettes.

    Args:
        task_id: The ID of the task
        image_data: Image data as bytes
        palettes: List of color palettes
        user_id: User ID
        image_service: ImageService instance

    Returns:
        List of palette variations with URLs

    Raises:
        Exception: If creation of variations fails
    """
```

This function creates variations of the base image using different color palettes:

1. Calls the image service's `create_palette_variations` method
2. For each palette, applies it to the base image
3. Stores each variation and captures its URL
4. Returns the list of palettes, each enhanced with image paths and URLs

## Usage Example

```python
# Generate color palettes
palettes = await generate_palettes_for_concept(
    task_id=task_id,
    theme_desc=theme_description,
    logo_desc=logo_description,
    num=7,
    concept_service=concept_service
)

# Create variations with these palettes
variations = await create_palette_variations(
    task_id=task_id,
    image_data=image_data,
    palettes=palettes,
    user_id=user_id,
    image_service=image_service
)

# Now variations can be stored with the concept
concept_id = await store_concept(
    task_id=task_id,
    user_id=user_id,
    # ...other parameters...
    color_palettes=variations,
    concept_persistence_service=concept_persistence_service
)
```

## Error Handling

Both functions include specialized error handling:

- JigsawStack API errors are caught specifically for palette generation
- Memory errors and timeouts are identified for variation creation
- Invalid responses are checked and rejected

## Performance Considerations

- Palette generation can be time-consuming, so it's often run concurrently with image storage
- Creating variations is processor-intensive, especially with many palettes
- Both functions include detailed timing information for performance monitoring

## Structure of Palette Data

A palette dictionary typically includes:

```python
{
    "name": "Cool Blue",  # Descriptive name of the palette
    "colors": ["#123456", "#789ABC", "#DEF012"],  # List of hex color codes
    "description": "A cool blue palette with gold accents"  # Description of the palette
}
```

After variation creation, each palette is enhanced with:

```python
{
    # ...existing palette fields...
    "image_path": "path/to/variation.png",  # Storage path
    "image_url": "https://example.com/variation.png"  # Accessible URL
}
```
