# Backend Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Concept Visualizer backend, which is built with FastAPI and follows a layered architecture pattern.

## Architecture Overview

The backend follows a clean architecture with the following layers:

1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, routing, and input validation
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and coordinates with external services
3. **Models Layer**: Defines data structures and validation
4. **Core Layer**: Provides configuration, logging, and infrastructure
5. **Utils Layer**: Contains reusable utility functions

## Key Directories

└── utils/            # Utility functions
```

## Key Concepts

### Dependency Injection

The application uses FastAPI's dependency injection system with a centralized `dependencies.py` file that provides common dependencies across endpoints.

### Error Handling

Custom error handling is implemented through the `errors.py` module, providing consistent error responses across the API.

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse of the API, with configuration in `core/rate_limiter.py` and middleware applied in the main application.

### Authentication

Session-based authentication is used for tracking user sessions, with cookies storing session identifiers.
