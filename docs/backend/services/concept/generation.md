# Concept Generation Service

The concept generation module provides implementation details for generating visual concepts and color palettes using external AI services.

## Overview

This module is responsible for:

1. Converting user text prompts into polished visual concepts
2. Processing prompt inputs to optimize image generation
3. Calling the external image generation service (JigsawStack API)
4. Handling response parsing and error management

## Service Integration

The generation module integrates with the JigsawStack service to perform AI-powered image generation. It extends the base concept service functionality by adding specialized concept generation capabilities.

## Key Functions

### Generate Base Image

```python
async def generate_base_image(
    prompt: str,
    model: str = "dall-e-3",
    width: int = 1024,
    height: int = 1024
) -> GeneratedImage:
    """Generate a base image from a text prompt."""
```

This function is responsible for:

1. Preprocessing the prompt to improve generation quality
2. Sending the generation request to the AI service
3. Processing the response into a standardized format
4. Handling any errors that occur during generation

**Parameters:**

- `prompt`: Text description of the image to generate
- `model`: AI model to use for generation (default: "dall-e-3")
- `width`: Desired image width in pixels (default: 1024)
- `height`: Desired image height in pixels (default: 1024)

**Returns:**

- `GeneratedImage`: Object containing the generated image data and metadata

**Raises:**

- `ServiceUnavailableError`: If the external API is unavailable
- `GenerationError`: If image generation fails for any reason

### Enhance Prompt

```python
def enhance_prompt(original_prompt: str, context: str = "logo") -> str:
    """Enhance the user's prompt with additional context for better results."""
```

This function improves raw user prompts by adding context and specificity to get better results from the AI model.

**Parameters:**

- `original_prompt`: The user's original text description
- `context`: The generation context (e.g., "logo", "icon")

**Returns:**

- Enhanced prompt string with additional details and specifications

## Error Handling

The generation module implements robust error handling:

1. Connection errors are caught and transformed into appropriate application exceptions
2. Timeout handling ensures the service remains responsive
3. Rate limit detection prevents excessive API usage
4. Response validation ensures the returned data meets expected formats

## Usage Example

```python
# Creating and using the generation service
from app.services.concept.generation import ConceptGenerationService
from app.services.jigsawstack.client import JigsawStackClient

# Create the required client
client = JigsawStackClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Initialize the generation service
generation_service = ConceptGenerationService(client)

# Generate a logo image
result = await generation_service.generate_base_image(
    prompt="A modern tech company logo with abstract geometric shapes",
    model="dall-e-3",
    width=1024,
    height=1024
)

# Access the generated image
image_data = result.image_data
image_url = result.image_url
```

## Performance Considerations

- The service uses asynchronous HTTP requests to prevent blocking
- Image generation can take several seconds depending on complexity
- Results are cached where appropriate to improve performance
- Rate limits are respected to ensure sustainable API usage
