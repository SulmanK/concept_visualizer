# Frontend Documentation

This section contains comprehensive documentation for the Concept Visualizer frontend application.

## Structure

The frontend is a React application built with TypeScript, organized into the following main sections:

- **API**: API client functions for interacting with the backend
- **Assets**: Static assets used in the application
- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Config**: Application configuration
- **Contexts**: React context providers
- **Features**: Feature-specific components and logic
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks
- **Services**: Service layer for external API interactions
- **Styles**: Global styles and theme-related files
- **Types**: TypeScript type definitions
- **Utils**: Utility functions used throughout the application

## Key Files

- `App.tsx`: Main application component
- `main.tsx`: Application entry point
- `theme.tsx`: MUI theme configuration
- `setupTests.ts`: Test configuration

## Getting Started

To understand the frontend architecture, start by exploring:

1. The feature directories to understand user-facing functionality
2. The components directory to understand the UI building blocks
3. The services directory to understand data fetching and API interactions
