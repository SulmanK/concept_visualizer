# HowItWorks

The HowItWorks component explains the concept visualization process through a clear, step-by-step guide with visual elements.

## Overview

This component provides an educational section on the landing page that helps users understand how the concept visualization process works, from input to output, with a focus on simplicity and clarity.

## Component Structure

```tsx
const HowItWorks: React.FC = () => {
  const steps = [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "Describe Your Concept",
      description:
        "Enter a detailed description of your brand concept, including the logo vision and theme elements.",
      icon: "edit",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "AI Generation",
      description:
        "Our AI analyzes your description and creates unique visual concepts tailored to your specifications.",
      icon: "sparkles",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      title: "Review & Refine",
      description:
        "View your generated concepts, select favorites, and refine them with additional feedback.",
      icon: "refresh",
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      title: "Export & Use",
      description:
        "Download your finished concepts in multiple formats ready for professional use.",
      icon: "download",
    },
  ];

  return (
    <section className="how-it-works-section">
      <h2 className="section-title">How It Works</h2>

      <div className="steps-container">
        {steps.map((step) => (
          <div key={step.id} className="step-card">
            <div className="step-icon">
              <Icon name={step.icon} size="large" />
            </div>

            <h3 className="step-title">
              {step.id}. {step.title}
            </h3>

            <p className="step-description">{step.description}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <div className="process-visualization">
        <FeatureSteps steps={steps} />
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};
```

## Features

- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Clear explanation of the end-to-end process
- **Visual Icons**: Intuitive icons that reinforce each step
- **Process Visualization**: Visual representation of the workflow
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Dependencies

- `Icon`: Component for displaying step icons
- `FeatureSteps`: Component that visualizes the steps as a connected process

## Props

This component does not accept any props as it's designed to be self-contained.

## Data Structure

```tsx
interface Step {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string; // Icon name from the icon library
}
```

## Styling

- **Card Layout**: Each step is presented in a card-like container
- **Visual Flow**: Steps are connected visually to show progression
- **Responsive Grid**: Adjusts from horizontal to vertical layout on smaller screens
- **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform spacing between elements for visual harmony

## Related Components

- [Icon](../../../../components/ui/Icon.md) (if available)
- [FeatureSteps](../../../../components/ui/FeatureSteps.md)
- [LandingPage](../LandingPage.md)

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Sufficient color contrast for text readability
- Non-visual representations of the process for screen readers
- Sequential navigation through steps

## Usage

This component is typically used in the landing page to educate users about the process:

```tsx
const LandingPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <MainLayout>
      <ConceptHeader />
      <ConceptFormSection />
      <HowItWorks />
      {/* Other sections */}
    </MainLayout>
  );
};
```

## Performance Considerations

- Static content that doesn't require data fetching
- Minimal JavaScript for interactive elements
- SVG icons for crisp rendering at any size
