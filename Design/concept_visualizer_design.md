# Concept Visualizer Design Document

## Current Context
- Currently there is no existing system - this is a new application
- The application will be a simple web-based tool for generating visual concepts and color palettes
- Need to address the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations in creative workflows

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Allow users to input descriptions for a logo and theme
- Generate a base image based on user's logo description
- Generate multiple hex color palette variations based on the theme
- Provide ability to refine results by adding more details to the original prompt
- Display results visually in an intuitive interface

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Responsive web interface that works on both desktop and mobile
- Fast response times (ideally under 5 seconds for generation)
- Secure handling of user inputs and API integrations
- Scalable architecture to handle multiple concurrent users
- Accessible design following WCAG guidelines

## Design Decisions

### 1. Tech Stack
Will implement using Python (backend) and React (frontend) because:
- Python offers excellent support for AI/ML integrations and image processing
- React provides a component-based architecture ideal for this interactive UI
- This combination allows for separation of concerns between UI and processing logic
- Deployment on Vercel simplifies CI/CD and offers good performance
- UV will be used for Python package management for better dependency resolution and performance

### 2. API Integration
Will use JigsawStack API for image generation because:
- Provides high-quality image generation capabilities
- Offers customizable parameters for fine-tuning outputs
- Has reliable documentation and support
- Can be integrated with other JigsawStack APIs for enhanced functionality

### 3. Color Palette Generation
Will primarily use JigsawStack's Text Generation API for color palette generation because:
- Provides semantic understanding of themes (e.g., "corporate," "playful")
- Generates color palettes that are conceptually aligned with themes
- Offers flexibility in requesting specific palette types and formats
- Can provide explanations for color choices to enhance user understanding
- More consistent quality compared to image-based extraction methods

Secondary approaches that may complement the primary method:
- Optional fallback to algorithmic generation for complementary colors
- User customization of AI-generated palettes

## Technical Design

### 1. Core Components
```python
# Backend Core Components
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
import requests
import logging
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class PromptRequest(BaseModel):
    """Model for user prompt requests"""
    logo_description: str = Field(..., min_length=3, max_length=500)
    theme_description: str = Field(..., min_length=3, max_length=500)
    
class RefinementRequest(BaseModel):
    """Model for refinement requests"""
    original_prompt_id: str
    additional_details: str = Field(..., min_length=3, max_length=500)
    
class ColorPalette(BaseModel):
    """Model for a color palette"""
    name: str
    colors: List[str]  # Hex codes
    description: Optional[str] = None
    
class GenerationResponse(BaseModel):
    """Model for generation response"""
    prompt_id: str
    image_url: str
    color_palettes: List[ColorPalette]

class JigsawStackClient:
    """Client for interacting with JigsawStack APIs"""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "https://api.jigsawstack.com"
        self.logger = logging.getLogger("jigsawstack_client")
    
    async def generate_image(self, prompt: str, params: Dict = None) -> Dict:
        """Generate image using JigsawStack Image Generation API"""
        # Implementation details
        pass
        
    async def generate_text(self, prompt: str, params: Dict = None) -> Dict:
        """Generate text using JigsawStack Text Generation API"""
        # Implementation details
        pass

async def generate_color_palette(theme_description: str) -> List[ColorPalette]:
    """Generate multiple color palettes based on theme description.
    
    Uses JigsawStack Text Generation API to create semantically relevant
    color palettes based on the provided theme.
    """
    prompt = f"""Generate 3 different color palettes in hex code format for: {theme_description}
    For each palette provide:
    1. A descriptive name (2-3 words)
    2. 5 hex color codes
    3. A one-sentence explanation of how it relates to the theme
    Format as JSON: [{{name: string, colors: string[], description: string}}]"""
    
    response = await jigsawstack_client.generate_text(prompt=prompt, params={"format": "json"})
    return parse_color_palette_response(response)
```

### 2. Data Models
```python
# Frontend Data Models (TypeScript)
interface PromptInput {
  logoDescription: string;
  themeDescription: string;
}

interface ColorPalette {
  name: string;
  colors: string[];  // Hex codes
  description?: string;
}

interface GenerationResult {
  promptId: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  colorPalettes: ColorPalette[];
}

// Error handling
interface ApiError {
  statusCode: number;
  message: string;
  details?: string;
}
```

### 3. Integration Points
- Frontend to Backend API:
  - POST /api/generate - Send prompt and receive generated content
  - POST /api/refine - Send refinement request for existing prompt
  
- Backend to JigsawStack APIs:
  - Image generation endpoint for logo creation
  - Text generation endpoint for color palette generation
  
- Data flow:
  1. User submits prompt via React UI
  2. Backend receives request and calls JigsawStack Image API for logo
  3. Backend calls JigsawStack Text API for color palette generation
  4. Results combined and returned to frontend for display
  5. User can refine results via additional prompts

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Basic Implementation
   - Setup project structure with UV for Python dependency management
   - Implement backend API with FastAPI
