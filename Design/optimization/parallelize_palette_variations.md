# Design Document: Parallelize Palette Variation Processing

## Problem Statement

Currently, palette variations are processed and uploaded sequentially in the `create_palette_variations` method of the `ImageService` class. This sequential processing is a significant bottleneck, taking approximately 1 minute per palette. For users with multiple palettes (e.g., 7 palettes), this results in a total processing time of around 7 minutes, which is too long for a good user experience.

## Proposed Solution

Implement asynchronous parallel processing of palette variations using `asyncio.gather()`. Instead of processing and uploading each variation sequentially, we'll create an async task for each variation and process them concurrently.

## Technical Details

### Current Implementation

The current implementation in `backend/app/services/image/service.py` processes palette variations sequentially in a loop:

```python
# Process each palette
for idx, palette in enumerate(palettes):
    # Extract palette data
    # Apply the palette
    # Store the result
    # Add to result_palettes
```

### Proposed Implementation

We'll refactor this to:

1. Create a helper async function that processes a single variation
2. Create async tasks for all variations using the helper function
3. Use `asyncio.gather()` to run all tasks concurrently
4. Handle any errors in individual task results

## Expected Benefits

- **Significant Performance Improvement**: Instead of n√ó1 minute for n palettes, the total time will be approximately equal to the time of the longest palette processing job, plus a small overhead.
- **Better Resource Utilization**: The parallel processing will better utilize CPU and network resources.
- **Improved User Experience**: Faster processing times will lead to a better user experience.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Resource Contention

Running multiple image processing tasks concurrently could lead to high CPU and memory usage.

**Mitigation**: We could add a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent tasks if needed, but for a reasonable number of palettes (5-10), this shouldn't be an issue on modern cloud infrastructure.

### Risk: Error Handling

If one variation fails, we don't want to fail the entire batch.

**Mitigation**: We'll use `return_exceptions=True` with `asyncio.gather()` to capture exceptions from individual tasks and handle them appropriately, allowing other tasks to complete successfully.

## Implementation Plan

1. Refactor the `create_palette_variations` method in `ImageService` class
2. Add proper error handling for individual task failures
3. Test the implementation with multiple palettes to verify performance improvements
4. Add logging to measure the performance before and after the change

## Future Considerations

If this approach proves successful, we could apply similar parallelization to other parts of the application that involve processing multiple items independently.
