# Frontend Supabase Integration

This document outlines the integration of Supabase with the frontend React application for Concept Visualizer.

## Components Implemented

1. **Supabase Client Configuration**
   - Created `supabaseClient.ts` to handle database interactions
   - Configured client with environment variables
   - Added utility functions for working with storage URLs

2. **Session Management**
   - Created `sessionManager.ts` for managing session cookies
   - Implemented functions for getting, setting, and clearing session IDs
   - Added function to ensure a session exists via API call

3. **API Client Updates**
   - Enhanced `useApi` hook to support cookies and credentials
   - Added session initialization on component mount
   - Provided better error handling for API requests

4. **Global State Management**
   - Implemented `ConceptContext` provider for shared concept state
   - Added functions for fetching and refreshing recent concepts
   - Set up error handling and loading states

5. **UI Components**
   - Created `RecentConcepts` component to display stored concepts
   - Built `ConceptDetail` component for individual concept pages
   - Updated `useConceptGeneration` hook to refresh concepts after generation
   - Enhanced App routing to include new components

## Data Flow

1. User generates a concept via the API
2. Concept is stored in Supabase by the backend
3. Frontend refreshes its concept list from Supabase
4. User can view recent concepts and their details

## Environment Configuration

Environment variables are stored in `.env`:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://pstdcfittpjhxzynbdbu.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## Dependencies Added

- `@supabase/supabase-js`: For Supabase client
- `js-cookie`: For managing browser cookies

## Future Improvements

1. **Offline Support**
   - Add caching of recently viewed concepts
   - Implement offline indicator when database can't be reached

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement pagination for large sets of concepts
   - Add caching layer to reduce database queries

3. **Enhanced Security**
   - Add CSRF protection for API requests
   - Implement proper token refresh flow

4. **UX Enhancements**
   - Add filters to the recent concepts view
   - Implement search functionality across concepts
   - Add favorites/bookmarking capability
