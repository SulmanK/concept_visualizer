# Design Document: Linting and Type Error Cleanup

## 1. Problem Statement

The backend codebase currently fails several pre-commit checks, specifically `flake8` for linting/style and `mypy` for type checking. This indicates potential code quality issues, inconsistencies, and potential runtime errors that need to be addressed to improve maintainability, readability, and reliability.

**Goal:** Resolve all reported `flake8` and `mypy` errors in the `backend/` directory to ensure the codebase passes pre-commit checks and adheres to project standards.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

We will systematically address the reported errors in phases, prioritizing critical issues like undefined names and missing type stubs first, followed by style/docstring issues.

**Phase 1: Mypy Fixes**

1.  **Install Missing Stubs:** Install required type stubs (e.g., `types-python-dateutil`).
2.  **Resolve Path Conflicts:** Address the `Source file found twice` error, likely by adjusting Mypy configuration (`pyproject.toml` or pre-commit args) to correctly understand the package structure (e.g., using `explicit_package_bases`, `namespace_packages`).
3.  **Address Core Type Errors:** Run `mypy` again and fix the most significant reported type errors, such as `[import-untyped]`, `[import-not-found]`, `[assignment]`, and `[name-defined]`, focusing on ensuring correct imports and basic type annotations.

**Phase 2: Flake8 Fixes (Critical)**

1.  **F821 (Undefined Name):** Address all `F821` errors. These are often critical and indicate missing imports or typos.
2.  **C901 (Complexity):** Refactor overly complex functions (like `get_limit_info`) into smaller, more manageable units.

**Phase 3: Flake8 Fixes (Imports & Style)**

1.  **F401 (Unused Import):** Remove all unused imports.
2.  **E\*** (Style/Whitespace): Address remaining style issues (many should be fixed by `black`/`isort`, but some like `E402` might need manual adjustment).
3.  **F541 (f-string):** Fix any f-strings that are missing placeholders.
4.  **F841 (Unused Local Variable):** Remove or utilize unused local variables.
5.  **E712 (Boolean Comparison):** Fix comparisons to `True` or `False`.

**Phase 4: Flake8 Fixes (Docstrings)**

1.  **D\*** (Docstrings): Add missing docstrings and correct formatting issues (D100, D107, D200, D202, D205, D212) according to project standards (Google style).

**Phase 5: Iteration & Validation**

1.  **Re-run Hooks:** Continuously run `pre-commit run --all-files` after each phase or major set of fixes.
2.  **Refine:** Address any remaining or newly introduced errors until all `flake8` and `mypy` checks pass.

## 3. Alternatives Considered

- **Fixing All at Once:** This is less systematic and harder to track progress.
- **Ignoring Errors:** This is not viable as it compromises code quality and prevents commits.
- **Disabling Rules:** Temporarily disabling rules might be necessary for complex type errors, but the goal is to fix them, not ignore them permanently.

---

## 4. High-Level Plan & Estimates

- **Phase 1 (Mypy Config & Stubs):** 0.5 - 1 hour
- **Phase 2 (Flake8 Critical):** 1 - 2 hours (Complexity refactoring might take time)
- **Phase 3 (Flake8 Imports/Style):** 1 - 1.5 hours
- **Phase 4 (Flake8 Docstrings):** 1 - 2 hours (Depends on number of missing docstrings)
- **Phase 5 (Mypy Core Errors & Iteration):** 2 - 4 hours (Addressing numerous `[import-not-found]` and other Mypy errors can be time-consuming)

**Total Estimated Time:** 5.5 - 10.5 hours

---

## 5. Open Questions & Risks

- **Mypy Path Configuration:** Finding the correct Mypy configuration to resolve path issues might require some trial and error.
- **Complex Type Errors:** Some Mypy errors, especially related to third-party libraries or complex logic, might be challenging to resolve correctly.
- **Refactoring Complexity:** Refactoring the `C901` complex function might introduce regressions if not tested carefully.
- **Volume of Errors:** The sheer number of docstring (D\*) and unused import (F401) errors will take time to address, although the fixes are straightforward.

### Mypy Errors (from `pre-commit run mypy --all-files`)

```

backend\app\api\errors.py:506: note: Hint: "python3 -m pip install types-python-dateutil"
backend\app\api\errors.py:506: note: (or run "mypy --install-types" to install all missing stub packages)
