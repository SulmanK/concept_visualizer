## 1. Goals

*   **Production Readiness:** Enhance robustness, security, and performance for production deployment.
*   **Maintainability & Scalability:** Improve code organization, reduce coupling, and adhere to Clean Code principles (SRP, DRY).
*   **Robust State Management:** Leverage React Query effectively for server state, streamline context usage, and ensure smooth UI updates without forced refreshes where possible.
*   **Background Task Implementation:** Replace risky global state middleware with a reliable background task mechanism for long-running operations (concept generation/refinement).
*   **Standardized URL Handling:** Ensure image URLs are handled consistently, preferably generated correctly by the backend.
*   **Architecture Adherence:** Align both frontend and backend code more closely with the defined architectural guidelines.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Clean Code:** Follow SOLID principles, especially Single Responsibility (SRP) and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY).
*   **Architecture:** Strictly adhere to the defined layered architecture (Backend) and feature-based organization (Frontend).
*   **State Management:** Utilize React Query as the primary tool for server state, caching, and mutations. Minimize redundant client-side state.
*   **Performance:** Optimize API calls, database queries, image processing, and frontend rendering. Use background tasks for non-blocking operations.
*   **Security:** Prioritize secure handling of credentials, user data, and access control (RLS). Use signed URLs for storage access.
*   **Testability:** Structure code to be easily unit and integration tested.

## 3. Backend Refactoring Plan

**3.1. Implement Background Tasks (Replace PrioritizationMiddleware)**

*   **Remove:** `backend/app/core/middleware/prioritization.py` and its registration in `backend/app/core/factory.py`.
*   **Choose Task Runner:** Utilize FastAPI's built-in `BackgroundTasks`.
*   **Modify API Routes:**
    *   Inject `BackgroundTasks` into relevant routes (`generation.py`, `refinement.py`).
    *   Modify `POST /concepts/generate-with-palettes` and `POST /concepts/refine` handlers:
        *   Validate input.
        *   Generate a unique Task ID (optional but recommended for tracking).
        *   Add the core generation/refinement logic (calling the service method) to the background tasks queue using `background_tasks.add_task()`.
        *   Immediately return a response to the client (e.g., `202 Accepted` with a task ID or a simple confirmation).
*   **Create Task Logic:**
    *   Define functions within services (e.g., `ConceptService`, `ImageService`) or a new `tasks` module that contain the actual logic previously executed directly in the route (calling JigsawStack, storing results). These functions will be passed to `background_tasks.add_task()`.
    *   Ensure these task functions handle their own errors and logging appropriately.

**3.2. Service Layer Granularity (SRP)**

*   **Modify `ImageService` (`backend/app/services/image/service.py`):**
    *   Split responsibilities further *if complexity warrants it later*. For now, ensure it correctly orchestrates `ImageStorageService`, `processing.py`, and `conversion.py`.
    *   Delegate JigsawStack interactions specifically related to *image* generation/refinement to a potential (future) `ImageGenerationService` or keep within `ImageService` but clearly separated.
*   **Modify `ConceptService` (`backend/app/services/concept/service.py`):**
    *   Ensure `ConceptGenerator`, `ConceptRefiner`, `PaletteGenerator` remain focused on their single tasks. The orchestration role here seems appropriate.

**3.3. Rate Limiting Application**

*   **Modify `backend/app/utils/api_limits/endpoints.py`:** Refine `apply_rate_limit` and `apply_multiple_rate_limits`.
*   **Modify API Routes (e.g., `generation.py`, `export_routes.py`):**
    *   Replace direct calls to `apply_rate_limit`/`apply_multiple_rate_limits` within route handlers.
    *   **Option A (Middleware Enhancement):** Enhance `RateLimitHeadersMiddleware` or create a new `RateLimitApplyMiddleware` that uses route information (decorators or path matching) to apply limits *before* the route handler executes.
    *   **Option B (FastAPI Depends):** Create FastAPI dependency functions that perform the rate limit check and raise HTTPException if exceeded. Inject these dependencies into the routes. `Depends(RateLimit("10/minute"))`.
*   **Modify `backend/app/utils/api_limits/decorators.py`:** Extract the logic for storing rate limit info into a reusable dependency function instead of a decorator, making it injectable via `Depends`.

**3.4. Supabase Client & Storage**

*   **Modify `backend/app/core/supabase/client.py`:**
    *   Ensure this file *only* deals with creating/configuring Supabase client instances.
    *   **Move `purge_all_data`:** Relocate this function to a dedicated administrative service or script (e.g., `backend/app/services/admin/cleanup_service.py` or modify `backend/supabase/functions/cleanup-old-data/handler.py`).
*   **Modify `backend/app/core/supabase/image_storage.py`:**
    *   **Add Comments:** Add clear comments explaining why direct `requests` calls are used for signed URLs/uploads, referencing Supabase limitations if applicable.
    *   **Review:** Periodically check Supabase client library updates to see if direct requests can be replaced by SDK methods.

**3.5. DRY - Route Logic**

*   **Refactor `backend/app/api/routes/concept/generation.py`:**
    *   Extract the duplicated logic for storing rate limit info in `request.state` (used by `RateLimitHeadersMiddleware`) into a reusable dependency function (as mentioned in 3.3).

**3.6. URL Handling Consistency**

*   **Modify Services (e.g., `ImageService`, `ConceptStorageService`):** Ensure methods that return concept/image data always include ready-to-use, absolute, signed URLs (where applicable) using the standardized `ImageStorageService.get_signed_url`.


**3.8. Legacy Code Cleanup**

*   **Review/Remove:**
    *   `backend/app/api/routes/api.py`
    *   `backend/app/models/concept.py`
    *   `backend/app/models/request.py`
    *   `backend/app/models/response.py`
    *   `backend/app/services/concept_service.py`
    *   `backend/app/services/image_processing.py`
    *   `backend/app/services/image_service.py`
    *   Determine if `backend/app/services/concept_storage_service.py` should be moved fully into `backend/app/services/storage/concept_storage.py` and the root file removed.

## 4. Frontend Refactoring Plan

**4.1. State Management (React Query Focus)**

*   **Remove Context:**
    *   **Remove:** `frontend/my-app/src/contexts/ConceptContext.tsx`.
    *   **Modify:** Update any components importing `useConceptContext` to use `useRecentConcepts` or `useConceptDetail` hooks directly.
*   **Review Caching:**
    *   **Modify:** `frontend/my-app/src/main.tsx`. Confirm `staleTime: 1000 * 10` is the desired behavior for frequent background updates.
*   **Optimize Queries:**
    *   **Modify:** `frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useConceptQueries.ts`. Evaluate if `useFreshConceptDetail`'s forced refetch is still needed. Test if relying on short `staleTime` and `queryClient.invalidateQueries` provides sufficient freshness after mutations.

**4.2. Component Consolidation & Structure**

*   **Consolidate `ConceptCard`:**
    *   **Merge:** Logic from `frontend/my-app/src/features/landing/components/ConceptCard.tsx` and `frontend/my-app/src/features/concepts/recent/components/ConceptCard.tsx`.
    *   **Create:** A single reusable card, likely in `frontend/my-app/src/components/concept/` or a new `frontend/my-app/src/components/shared/concepts/`.
    *   **Modify:** `RecentConceptsSection.tsx` and any other users to import and use the consolidated card.
*   **Review UI Components (`components/ui`):** Ensure strict adherence to SRP â€“ no feature-specific logic.
*   **Review Feature Components (`features/`):** Ensure components primarily use shared UI components and feature-specific hooks/logic. Minimize direct cross-feature imports.

**4.3. URL Handling Consistency**

*   **Simplify Frontend Logic:**
    *   **Modify:** `frontend/my-app/src/services/supabaseClient.ts`. Aim to simplify or remove complex URL parsing/formatting in `getImageUrl` and `getSignedImageUrl`. Rely on the backend providing complete, correct URLs. If fallbacks are needed, ensure they are robust.
    *   **Modify:** `frontend/my-app/src/features/landing/components/ConceptCard.tsx` (or the consolidated version) and `frontend/my-app/src/components/ui/OptimizedImage.tsx` to expect and use ready-to-use URLs.
    *   **Modify:** `frontend/my-app/src/utils/url.ts`. Simplify or remove `extractStoragePathFromUrl` if no longer needed.

**4.4. Page Transitions**

*   **Fix/Remove:**
    *   **Modify:** `frontend/my-app/src/App.tsx`. Reinstate the `PageTransition` component.
    *   **Debug/Modify:** `frontend/my-app/src/components/layout/PageTransition.tsx`. Address the underlying issue causing it to be bypassed. Ensure it handles state synchronization correctly, especially with React Query data fetching across page loads. Test different navigation scenarios thoroughly. If it proves too problematic, remove it for now.

**4.5. API Client & Fetch Interceptor**

*   **Review/Modify:** `frontend/my-app/src/App.tsx`. Consider moving the fetch interceptor logic into `frontend/my-app/src/services/apiClient.ts` using Axios interceptors (if switching to Axios) or refining the global fetch wrapper to be more robust and less likely to interfere with non-API calls.

**4.6. Legacy Hooks**

*   **Review/Remove:**
    *   `frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useConceptGeneration.ts`
    *   `frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useConceptRefinement.ts`
    *   `frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useApi.ts`
    *   Ensure all relevant components are using the React Query-based hooks (`useConceptMutations.ts`, `useConceptQueries.ts`, `useExportImageMutation.ts`) and the core `apiClient`.

**4.7. Code Quality**

*   **Remove/Guard:** All `console.log` statements intended for debugging.
*   **Refactor:** Look for opportunities to apply DRY principle to UI rendering logic (e.g., loading/error states in lists).

4.7. Code Quality Improvements
A. console.log Cleanup (Remove/Guard for Production)

These files contain console.log, console.warn, or console.error statements primarily used for debugging during development. They should be reviewed and either removed or conditionally executed (e.g., if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')) before deploying to production, unless they represent essential error logging.

    Contexts:

        frontend/my-app/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx: Contains extensive logging of auth state changes, token refresh logic.

        frontend/my-app/src/contexts/RateLimitContext.tsx: Logs in enhancedRefetch.

        frontend/my-app/src/contexts/ConceptContext.tsx: Logs event handling (Context likely to be removed).

    Services:

        frontend/my-app/src/services/apiClient.ts: Logs auth header retrieval.

        frontend/my-app/src/services/supabaseClient.ts: Logs fetching, processing, URL generation, errors. (Keep essential error logs).

        frontend/my-app/src/services/sessionManager.ts: Logs session ID status, setting, syncing. (Likely removed).

        frontend/my-app/src/services/rateLimitService.ts: Logs header extraction and category mapping.

        frontend/my-app/src/services/tokenService.ts: Logs token loading/saving. (Legacy?).

    Hooks:

        frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useConceptGeneration.ts: Logs generation start, success.

        frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useConceptMutations.ts: Extensive logging of mutation lifecycle and data.

        frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useConceptQueries.ts: Extensive logging of query state, cache status, fetching details.

        frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useConceptRefinement.ts: Logs refinement start.

        frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useExportImageMutation.ts: Logs export/preview process, success/error. (Keep essential error logs).

        frontend/my-app/src/hooks/useRateLimitsQuery.ts: Logs in enhancedRefetch.

    Components:

        frontend/my-app/src/App.tsx: Logs interceptor setup, debug info.

        frontend/my-app/src/components/concept/ConceptResult.tsx: Logs concept/variation data, image loading errors. (Keep essential error logs).

        frontend/my-app/src/features/concepts/detail/ConceptDetailPage.tsx: Logs mount/refetch actions, errors. (Keep essential error logs).

        frontend/my-app/src/features/concepts/detail/components/ExportOptions.tsx: Extensive logging of state changes, preview/download actions, errors. (Keep essential error logs).

        frontend/my-app/src/features/concepts/recent/components/ConceptCard.tsx: Logs palette clicks, image processing.

        frontend/my-app/src/features/concepts/recent/components/ConceptList.tsx: Logs render state.

        frontend/my-app/src/features/landing/LandingPage.tsx: Logs generation start, color selection, duplicate submission warnings. (Keep warnings if useful).

        frontend/my-app/src/features/refinement/RefinementPage.tsx: Logs disabled feature message, errors. (Keep error logs).

B. DRY Refactoring Opportunities (UI Logic - Loading/Error/Empty States)

These components exhibit similar patterns for handling loading, error, and empty data states, making them candidates for refactoring to reduce code duplication.

    frontend/my-app/src/features/concepts/recent/components/ConceptList.tsx:

        Issue: Explicitly checks loadingConcepts, errorLoadingConcepts, and recentConcepts.length to render different UI states (loading skeleton, error message with retry, empty message with create button, or the actual list).

        Suggestion: Create a reusable component (e.g., QueryResultHandler or DataDisplayWrapper) that takes the query result (data, isLoading, error, refetch) as props and handles rendering the appropriate state internally.

    frontend/my-app/src/features/refinement/RefinementSelectionPage.tsx:

        Issue: Similar pattern to ConceptList, checking loadingConcepts, errorLoadingConcepts, and recentConcepts.length to render loading skeleton, error + retry, or empty state + create button.

        Suggestion: Use the same QueryResultHandler component proposed for ConceptList.

    frontend/my-app/src/features/concepts/detail/ConceptDetailPage.tsx:

        Issue: Checks loading and error states to render a specific loading skeleton or an error message with a back button.

        Suggestion: Adapt the QueryResultHandler to handle detail views, potentially accepting different components for loading/error/success states, or create a specific variant for detail pages.

    frontend/my-app/src/features/landing/components/ResultsSection.tsx:

        Issue: Contains a specific, detailed skeleton structure rendered when isLoading is true.

        Suggestion: While the overall section logic might remain, the skeleton part could potentially be extracted into a dedicated ConceptResultSkeleton component, making the ResultsSection cleaner. The proposed QueryResultHandler could also potentially take a custom skeleton component as a prop.

Proposed Refactoring Approach for DRY:

    Create QueryResultHandler Component:

        Location: frontend/my-app/src/components/ui/QueryResultHandler.tsx

        Props:

            isLoading: boolean

            error: Error | string | null

            data: T | null | undefined (Generic data type)

            onRetry?: () => void

            loadingComponent?: ReactNode (Optional custom loading UI)

            errorComponent?: ReactNode (Optional custom error UI)

            emptyComponent?: ReactNode (Optional custom empty UI for list views)

            children: (data: T) => ReactNode (Function to render when data is available)

            isEmptyCheck?: (data: T) => boolean (Function to check if data is considered empty, e.g., data => !data || data.length === 0)

        Logic:

            If isLoading, render loadingComponent or a default SkeletonLoader.

            If error, render errorComponent or a default ErrorMessage with onRetry.

            If !data or isEmptyCheck(data) returns true, render emptyComponent or a default empty message.

            Otherwise, call children(data) to render the successful state.

    Refactor Components: Update ConceptList, RefinementSelectionPage, and ConceptDetailPage to use QueryResultHandler, passing their specific loading/error/empty/success render logic/components as props or children.

Backend Code Quality Improvements
A. logger Cleanup (Review/Remove/Guard for Production)

Similar to the frontend, the backend uses Python's logging module. Review these files for logger.info() and logger.debug() calls that might be too verbose for production or only intended for development debugging. Keep logger.error() and relevant logger.warning() calls.

    API Middleware:

        backend/app/api/middleware/auth_middleware.py: Logs auth status, public paths, token details (masked). Review log levels; DEBUG seems appropriate for most.

        backend/app/api/middleware/rate_limit_headers.py: Logs added headers (DEBUG level). Keep as DEBUG.

    API Routes:

        backend/app/api/routes/auth/auth_routes.py: Logs user creation/refresh/signout (INFO/ERROR). Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/api/routes/concept/generation.py: Logs generation start, rate limit info (DEBUG), errors. Review DEBUG logs.

        backend/app/api/routes/concept/refinement.py: Logs refinement start, errors. Review DEBUG logs if added.

        backend/app/api/routes/concept_storage/storage_routes.py: Logs operations, errors. Review INFO/DEBUG levels.

        backend/app/api/routes/export/export_routes.py: Logs processing, errors. Review INFO/DEBUG levels.

        backend/app/api/routes/health/check.py: Logs health check status/errors. Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/api/routes/health/endpoints.py: Logs pings. Keep as INFO or DEBUG.

        backend/app/api/routes/health/limits.py: Extensive DEBUG logging for rate limit checks, key generation, caching. Keep as DEBUG.

        backend/app/api/routes/health/utils.py: Contains masking functions, logging might be minimal here.

    Core:

        backend/app/core/config.py: Logs configuration loading, environment, masked sensitive values (DEBUG). Keep as DEBUG.

        backend/app/core/exceptions.py: Logging handled by error handlers, not directly here.

        backend/app/core/factory.py: Logs middleware registration, CORS config (INFO). Keep essential INFO logs.

        backend/app/core/limiter/config.py: Logs Redis connection status, limiter setup (INFO/WARNING/ERROR). Keep.

        backend/app/core/limiter/decorators.py: Logs errors during rate limiting (ERROR). Keep.

        backend/app/core/limiter/keys.py: Logs key generation strategy (DEBUG). Keep as DEBUG.

        backend/app/core/limiter/redis_store.py: Logs Redis operations, connection errors (DEBUG/INFO/ERROR/WARNING). Keep essential logs, review DEBUG verbosity.

        backend/app/core/supabase/client.py: Logs client initialization, service role usage, JWT verification issues, errors (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR). Keep essential logs, review DEBUG.

        backend/app/core/supabase/concept_storage.py: Logs storage operations, service role usage, errors (INFO/WARNING/ERROR). Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/core/supabase/image_storage.py: Logs uploads, URL generation, errors (INFO/WARNING/ERROR). Keep essential logs.

    Services:

        backend/app/services/concept/generation.py: Logs generation start, errors. Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/services/concept/palette.py: Logs palette generation, errors. Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/services/concept/refinement.py: Logs refinement start, errors. Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/services/concept/service.py: Logs service method calls (INFO). Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/services/export/service.py: Logs export process, image fetching, errors. Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/services/image/service.py: Logs generation, refinement, variation creation, errors. Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/services/image/storage.py: Logs storage operations, URL generation, errors. Keep essential logs.

        backend/app/services/jigsawstack/client.py: Logs API calls, responses, errors. Review DEBUG verbosity, ensure sensitive data isn't logged excessively even if masked.

        backend/app/services/storage/concept_storage.py: Logs storage operations, errors. Keep essential logs.

    Utils:

        backend/app/utils/api_limits/decorators.py: Logs stored rate limit info (DEBUG), errors. Keep as DEBUG.

        backend/app/utils/api_limits/endpoints.py: Logs rate limit checks, status (INFO/DEBUG/WARNING). Keep essential logs, review DEBUG.

        backend/app/utils/jwt_utils.py: Logs JWT creation/verification errors (ERROR/WARNING). Keep.

        backend/app/utils/logging/setup.py: Logs successful configuration (INFO). Keep.

        backend/app/utils/security/mask.py: Minimal logging likely.

B. DRY Refactoring Opportunities (Backend Logic)

These backend files show patterns that could potentially be refactored to reduce repetition.

    Rate Limit Application & State Storage (backend/app/api/routes/concept/generation.py, export_routes.py, etc.):

        Issue: Multiple routes contain similar boilerplate code to:

            Call apply_rate_limit or apply_multiple_rate_limits.

            Manually call check_rate_limit again with check_only=True just to get the status (limit, remaining, reset) to store in request.state.limiter_info for the RateLimitHeadersMiddleware.

        Suggestion:

            Refactor the core rate limiting check (check_rate_limit or equivalent within SlowAPI) to return the status information directly when the limit is checked/incremented.

            Modify apply_rate_limit / apply_multiple_rate_limits (or the new dependency/middleware replacing them) to automatically store this returned status information into request.state.limiter_info. This removes the need for the second check_only=True call in every route.

    Supabase Service Role Fallback Logic (backend/app/core/supabase/concept_storage.py):

        Issue: Methods like store_concept, store_color_variations, get_recent_concepts, get_concept_detail contain a pattern of:

            Try operation with service role key (using direct requests).

            If it fails or isn't available, fall back to using the standard Supabase client (self.client.client).

        Suggestion: Create a private helper method within ConceptStorage (e.g., _execute_supabase_op) that encapsulates this try-service-role-then-fallback logic. This helper would take the operation details (table, method, data) and execute it using the preferred method first.

    JigsawStack API Request Handling (backend/app/services/jigsawstack/client.py):

        Issue: Methods like generate_image, refine_image, generate_multiple_palettes share common logic for:

            Setting up headers.

            Making httpx.AsyncClient requests (mostly POST).

            Handling connection/timeout errors (httpx.ConnectError, httpx.TimeoutException).

            Handling authentication errors (401/403).

            Handling general non-200 status codes.

            Parsing JSON responses or handling binary data.

        Suggestion: Create a private async helper method (e.g., _make_request) within JigsawStackClient. This method would take the endpoint, method, payload, timeout, etc., and handle the common request lifecycle, including error handling and response parsing, returning either the processed data or raising the appropriate JigsawStackError subclass.

    Image Upload/Storage Logic (backend/app/core/supabase/image_storage.py, backend/app/services/image/service.py):

        Issue: Logic related to generating unique filenames (user_id/uuid.ext), determining content type, and calling the storage upload function appears in multiple places (generate_and_store_image, refine_and_store_image, create_palette_variations within ImageService might duplicate parts of ImageStorageService.store_image).

        Suggestion: Ensure all image storage logic resides strictly within ImageStorageService.store_image. Higher-level services like ImageService should prepare the image data and metadata and then call ImageStorageService.store_image, passing the necessary parameters (like user_id, concept_id, is_palette). Filename generation should also be centralized there.

    Error Handling Boilerplate (try...except blocks):

        Issue: While using custom exceptions is good, there might be repetitive try...except SpecificError...except Exception as e blocks in services or API routes where the handling (logging, raising a different error) is very similar.

        Suggestion:

            For API routes, rely more heavily on the FastAPI exception handlers (api_error_handler, application_error_handler) defined in api/errors.py. Let exceptions bubble up from services unless specific handling is needed at the route level.

            Within services, consider if common error handling patterns (e.g., catching a JigsawStackError and re-raising as a ConceptError) can be abstracted using decorators or helper functions if the pattern is identical in many places.

## 7. Testing Strategy

*   **Backend:**
    *   Add unit tests for new background task functions.
    *   Add integration tests for API routes triggering background tasks (verify task queuing and initial response).
    *   Enhance tests for refactored services (SRP focus).
    *   Test error handling paths for background tasks.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Update component tests relying on `ConceptContext` or legacy hooks.
    *   Add tests for the consolidated `ConceptCard`.
    *   Test components relying on React Query state, mocking query responses.
    *   Thoroughly test `PageTransition` if kept.
    *   Verify error handling UI components (`ErrorMessage`, `RateLimitErrorMessage`) display correctly based on query/mutation errors.
*   **E2E:**
    *   Update existing E2E tests to reflect any UI/UX changes from refactoring.
    *   Add E2E tests covering the background task flow (e.g., submitting generation, checking results later if UI changes).
    *   Ensure visual/accessibility tests still pass after refactoring.

## 8. Next Steps

1.  Review and approve this design plan.
2.  Break down the plan into smaller, manageable tasks/tickets.
3.  Prioritize tasks (e.g., Backend Background Tasks first, then Frontend state cleanup).
5.  Conduct code reviews for refactored sections.
