# Frontend State Management Refactor Progress

This document tracks the progress of the frontend state management refactor using React Query.

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### Phase 1: Core React Query Integration

1. **Refactored `useRateLimits` to `useRateLimitsQuery`**

   - Implemented using `useQuery` from React Query
   - Added data caching and automatic refetching
   - Configured background updates with proper stale times
   - Added optimistic update capabilities

2. **Integrated `useRateLimitsQuery` into `RateLimitProvider`**

   - Updated context to use the new `useRateLimitsQuery` hook
   - Created selector hooks for consuming specific parts of the data
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing component usage

3. **Converted Mutation Hooks to React Query**

   - Refactored `useConceptGeneration` to `useGenerateConceptMutation`
   - Refactored `useConceptRefinement` to `useRefineConceptMutation`
   - Added proper type definitions and error handling
   - Implemented automatic cache invalidation on successful mutations
   - Configured optimistic UI updates for better user experience

4. **Standardized Query Key Structure**
   - Established consistent pattern for query keys: `[entity, operation, params]`
   - Example: `['concepts', 'recent', userId]`
   - Ensured consistent cache invalidation across related queries
   - Documented key patterns for future development

### Phase 2: Component Updates

1. **Migrated Components to Direct Query Hook Usage**

   - Updated `RateLimitsPanel` to use `useRateLimitsQuery` directly
   - Updated `LandingPage` to use query hooks directly
   - Updated `ConceptList` to use `useRecentConcepts` directly
   - Updated `ConceptDetailPage` to use `useConceptDetail`
   - Updated `RefinementPage` to use query hooks directly
   - Fixed TypeScript typing issues in all components

2. **Added New Query Hooks**

   - Created `useSvgConversionMutation` for SVG image processing
   - Refactored `ExportOptions` component to use the new mutation hook

3. **Removed Context Dependency**
   - Removed `ConceptProvider` from `App.tsx`
   - Updated all components to use React Query hooks directly
   - Maintained `RateLimitContext` but refactored it to use React Query internally
   - Eliminated redundant state management in contexts

### Phase 3: Cleanup and Optimization

1. **Simplified API Utilities**

   - Refactored `useApi` hook to a simpler utility that uses `apiClient`
   - Added a deprecation warning to encourage direct React Query usage
   - Provided standalone `apiGet` and `apiPost` utilities for non-hook usage

2. **Standardized Error Handling**

   - Created `createQueryErrorHandler` utility for consistent error handling
   - Implemented in all query and mutation hooks
   - Ensured proper toast notifications for errors
   - Added typed error handling for common error scenarios

3. **Optimized Component Re-renders**

   - Eliminated unnecessary re-renders by avoiding context where possible
   - Used React Query's built-in data caching to prevent redundant renders
   - Leveraged selectors for fine-grained state consumption

4. **Improved Event Handling**
   - Replaced event-based refreshing with `queryClient.invalidateQueries`
   - Created more direct data flow between actions and UI updates
   - Maintained event service only for necessary cross-component communication

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistent Data Fetching Pattern**

   - All server state is now managed through React Query
   - Standardized approach to loading, error, and data states
   - Simplified component code by removing manual state management

2. **Improved Performance**

   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders with optimized caching
   - Background data refreshing for improved perceived performance
   - Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback to user actions

3. **Better Developer Experience**

   - Clearer data flow and dependencies
   - Type-safe API with TypeScript integration
   - Consistent error handling approach
   - Simpler component code with less boilerplate

4. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Removed duplicate state management logic
   - Centralized caching and invalidation rules
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase
   - Better separation of concerns between components and data fetching

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing Updates**

   - Update test mocks to use React Query test utilities
   - Ensure proper coverage of optimistic updates
   - Validate error handling scenarios

2. **Documentation**

   - Complete API documentation for all new hooks
   - Document query key patterns for future extension
   - Update component documentation to reflect new patterns

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement metrics to validate performance improvements
   - Monitor server request patterns to optimize caching settings
   - Fine-tune stale times and refetch intervals based on actual usage
