# Frontend State Management Refactor

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a plan to review and refactor the frontend state management in the Concept Visualizer application. While the current implementation leverages modern React patterns (Context, Hooks, React Query), there are opportunities for optimization and consistency improvements to enhance performance, maintainability, and overall production readiness.

## 2. Problem Statement

The existing frontend state management, while functional, exhibits potential areas for improvement:

*   **Performance:** Context consumers might be re-rendering unnecessarily when unrelated parts of the context value change.
*   **Consistency:** Error handling patterns might not be uniformly applied across all asynchronous operations and data fetching points.
*   **Redundancy:** Server state management (loading, error, data) might be duplicated between custom context logic and React Query's capabilities.
*   **Traceability:** Heavy reliance on an event bus for state synchronization could potentially make data flow harder to trace in some scenarios.

Addressing these points will lead to a more performant, robust, and maintainable frontend application.

## 3. Goals

*   Optimize Context API usage to minimize unnecessary component re-renders.
*   Establish and enforce consistent error handling patterns across the frontend codebase.
*   Simplify server state management by fully leveraging React Query's built-in features.
*   Refine the usage of the `eventService` for state synchronization where appropriate.
*   Improve the overall maintainability and traceability of state changes.

## 4. Non-Goals

*   Complete replacement of the existing Context API structure (unless optimizations prove insufficient).
*   Introduction of a new global state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand) as the primary goal. Optimization of the current structure is preferred.
*   Refactoring local UI state within individual components unless it directly and significantly impacts global state interactions or performance.

## 5. Proposed Solution

The refactor will focus on the following key areas:

### 5.1. Context API Optimization

*   **Implement Selectors:** Introduce selectors for `RateLimitContext` and `ConceptContext`. Components consuming these contexts will subscribe only to the specific slices of state they need, preventing re-renders when unrelated parts of the context update. This can be achieved using libraries like `use-context-selector` or through careful manual implementation within the custom consumer hooks (`useRateLimitContext`, `useConceptContext`).
*   **Ensure Memoization:** Review context providers (`RateLimitProvider`, `ConceptProvider`) to ensure that provided values (especially objects and arrays) are memoized using `useMemo` or `useCallback` where necessary, preventing re-renders caused by new object references on each provider render.

### 5.2. Error Handling Consistency

*   **Audit Operations:** Conduct a thorough review of all asynchronous operations, including API calls made via `apiClient`, hooks like `useConceptQueries`, and authentication flows in `AuthContext`.
*   **Standardize Hook Usage:** Ensure the `useErrorHandling` hook is consistently integrated into all relevant places to categorize errors (network, server, validation, rate limit, etc.).
*   **Universal Error Display:** Promote the consistent use of `ErrorMessage` and `RateLimitErrorMessage` components across the application to provide standardized user feedback for errors.

### 5.3. React Query Simplification

*   **Centralize Server State:** Refactor `ConceptContext` (and potentially other areas managing server state) to rely *directly* on the state provided by React Query hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`, or custom wrappers like `useRecentConcepts`). Remove duplicated `isLoading`, `error`, and data state managed within the context itself.
*   **Expose React Query Functions:** Pass down functions like `refetch` directly from the React Query hook results via the context where needed, rather than wrapping them unnecessarily.

### 5.4. Event Service Refinement

*   **Review Event Usage:** Analyze the current uses of `eventService` for state synchronization (e.g., triggering `refreshConcepts` on `AppEvent.CONCEPT_CREATED`).
*   **Leverage Cache Invalidation:** Where appropriate, replace event-driven data refreshing with React Query's built-in cache invalidation mechanisms (`queryClient.invalidateQueries`). This often provides a more direct and traceable way to keep server state up-to-date after mutations.
*   **Judicious Use:** Retain `eventService` for scenarios requiring true decoupling between modules (e.g., notifying the rate limit system after an action in a different feature).

## 6. Alternative Solutions

*   **Dedicated State Management Library:** Introduce a library like Zustand or Jotai. While potentially effective, this adds a new dependency and learning curve, and optimizing the existing Context/React Query structure is preferred first.
*   **Prop Drilling:** Pass state down through props. This is generally discouraged for global state due to complexity in large applications.

## 7. Testing Plam

*   **Manual Testing:**
    *   Verify loading states appear correctly during data fetching.
    *   Confirm error messages (including rate limit details) are displayed consistently and correctly.
    *   Ensure data updates correctly after relevant actions (e.g., concept generation, refresh clicks).
    *   Test UI responsiveness in areas affected by optimized contexts.


## 8. Rollout Plan (Phased Approach)

1.  **Phase 1: Context Optimization:**
    *   Implement selectors and review memoization for `RateLimitContext`.
    *   Implement selectors and review memoization for `ConceptContext`.
    *   Profile and verify performance improvements.
2.  **Phase 2: React Query Simplification:**
    *   Refactor `ConceptContext` to directly use React Query state.
3.  **Phase 3: Error Handling Standardization:**
    *   Audit async operations and integrate `useErrorHandling` and `ErrorMessage` components universally.
4.  **Phase 4: Event Service Refinement:**
    *   Review event usage and replace with cache invalidation where suitable.
5.  **Each phase will involve implementation, testing, and code review.**

## 9. Open Questions

*   Are there any particularly complex state interactions or edge cases already known that might complicate these refactors?
*   What is the exact implementation pattern currently used in `useConceptQueries`? (Confirming it's a React Query wrapper).

## 10. Future Considerations

*   If context optimization with selectors proves insufficient for performance needs in highly dynamic parts of the app, revisiting dedicated state management libraries might be warranted later.
