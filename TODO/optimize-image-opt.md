Okay, a 5-10 minute execution time for the Cloud Run worker (which includes image generation and palette swapping) is definitely long, and 1 minute per palette swap + upload is also a significant bottleneck. Let's break down potential areas for optimization in your `backend/cloud_run/worker/main.py` and related services.

**Key Areas for Performance Improvement:**

If you must continue with local palette application:

1.  **Parallelize Palette Variation Creation and Upload:**

    - In `image_service.create_palette_variations` (in `backend/app/services/image/service.py`), you're likely looping through `raw_palettes` and processing/uploading them sequentially.
    - **Change:** Use `asyncio.gather` to process and upload these variations concurrently.

      ````python # In ImageService.create_palette_variations # ...
      tasks = []
      for idx, palette_info in enumerate(palettes): # ... (extract palette_name, palette_colors) ... # Create an async task for each variation
      tasks.append(
      self.\_process_and_store_single_variation(
      validated_image_data, # Assuming this is the base image bytes
      palette_info,
      user_id,
      blend_strength,
      timestamp, # Pass timestamp if needed for unique names
      idx
      )
      )

          # Run all variation processing tasks concurrently
          processed_variations_results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

          result_palettes = []
          for result in processed_variations_results:
              if isinstance(result, Exception):
                  self.logger.error(f"Error processing a variation: {result}")
                  # Decide how to handle partial failures
              elif result: # If your helper returns the dict
                  result_palettes.append(result)
          # ...

          # Helper async function for single variation processing
          async def _process_and_store_single_variation(self, base_data, palette_info, user_id, ...):
              colorized_image = await self.processing.process_image(...) # Your apply_palette logic
              # ...
              palette_path, palette_url = await self.persistence.store_image(...)
              return { ... "image_path": palette_path, "image_url": palette_url ... }
          ```

      **Impa\* ct:** This is likely the **biggest win** for the "1 minute per palette" part. If you have 7 palettes, instead of 7 minutes sequential, it could be closer to the time of the single longest palette processing/upload, assuming enough CPU/network resources.
