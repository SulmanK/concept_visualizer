Yes, your next steps are well-considered:
Update Tests and Documentation First:
Update unit tests to mock Pub/Sub instead of BackgroundTasks
Update integration tests to handle the async flow
Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
Document how the Pub/Sub messaging and worker processing work
Prepare for Cloud Run Deployment:
Finalize the Dockerfile.worker for production
Create deployment scripts or configurations
Set up environment variables in Cloud Run
Configure authentication for services
Deploy to Cloud Run:
Deploy the worker to Cloud Run
Configure the Pub/Sub topic and subscription properly
Set up proper IAM permissions
Create a service account for the worker
Continuous Deployment:
Integrate with your CI/CD pipelines
Add deployment steps for the worker
Set up monitoring and logging
This approach - updating tests and docs before deployment - is excellent. It ensures that your architecture is well-documented and tested before going into production, making future maintenance much easier.
Would you like me to help you with updating the tests or documentation for the new Pub/Sub-based architecture?
